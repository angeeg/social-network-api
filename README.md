## Description 
This node.js application is the back end routing for a social network application. It was created using MongoDB and the mongoose library. So far, the back end of this project has built RESTful APIs using CRUD methods to create a thoughtful, social networking community. 

## Installation 
1. Clone the <a href="https://github.com/angeeg/social-network-api.git">github repo</a> onto your machine in the directory you want to save it in. 
2. Open the repo in your code editor. 
3. Open the terminal in your code editor and run 'npm i' then run 'npm start' to start the server.
4. Run on localhost in Insomnia Core, or another api test application, to execute API routes. 

## Usage 
Use this application to manipulate data in MongoDB or eventually link to front-end for a complete website that puts the results of the routes into visible elements.
